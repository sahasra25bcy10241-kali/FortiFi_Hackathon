# Project Overview

SmartURL Guard is designed to improve cybersecurity awareness by helping users identify malicious URLs before interacting with them.

The project focuses on prevention rather than detection after damage occurs. Many attacks rely on user interaction with malicious links, making URL verification a critical first line of defense.

The system analyzes multiple URL attributes such as structure, keywords, symbols, and protocol usage to estimate risk levels.

This project demonstrates the application of basic cybersecurity principles in a practical and user-friendly way.
