# SmartURL Guard – Intelligent URL Safety Checker

## Overview
SmartURL Guard is a web-based cybersecurity tool that analyzes URLs and determines whether they are safe or suspicious before users open them.

It helps prevent phishing attacks, malware downloads, and data theft by providing instant URL risk analysis and awareness tips.

## Problem Statement
Users frequently click unknown links without checking their safety. Malicious URLs are one of the most common attack vectors used in cybercrime. Most users lack the knowledge or tools to verify link safety.

## Solution
SmartURL Guard evaluates URLs using rule-based security checks such as:

- URL length analysis
- Suspicious characters detection
- Keyword detection
- HTTPS validation
