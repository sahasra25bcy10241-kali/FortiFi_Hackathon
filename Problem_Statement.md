# Problem Statement

Cybercriminals commonly use malicious URLs to trick users into revealing personal data or downloading malware.

Challenges:
- Users cannot visually distinguish safe links from malicious ones
- Shortened URLs hide real destinations
- Phishing domains mimic real websites
- Most users lack technical awareness

Impact:
- Identity theft
- Financial fraud
- Account compromise
- Malware infections

There is a strong need for a simple, accessible tool that helps users evaluate URL safety before clicking.
